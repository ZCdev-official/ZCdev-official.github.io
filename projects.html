                  The first "real" programming that I did was on a platform called Roblox.
                  When I first joined the platform, I was just having fun playing games.
                  Then, I realized that I could make my own games to play on Roblox.
                  The first game that I created actually involved no coding at all.
                  And it sucked.
                  As I grew more interested, I began exploring the documentation to learn more about coding for Roblox.
                  As my experience with coding grew, the quality of my games improved significantly.
                  However, I could never finish any of my projects on Roblox because I did not have the motivation to.
                  On Roblox, the games that I made never got popular.
                  As a result, I moved on to web development.

                  Web development was scary at first.
                  It was all so different from the coding language that I learned for Roblox (Lua).
                  But once I got into, it was just a breeze.
                  Everything felt so much easier, which led to boredom.
                  As a result, I began to focus more on web design than web development, which kick-started my love of design.
                  Once I started to focus on the design, I was faced with a new challenge.
                  Coding websites was easy, but making them look good was hard.
                  After diving deep into web development, I started to look at how to do graphic design.

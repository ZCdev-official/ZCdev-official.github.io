                  The first "real" programming that I did was on a platform called Roblox.
                  When I first joined the platform, I was just having fun playing games.
                  Then, I realized that I could make my own games to play on Roblox.
                  The first game that I created actually involved no coding at all.
                  And it sucked.
                  As I grew more interested, I began exploring the documentation to learn more about coding for Roblox.
                  As my experience with coding grew, the quality of my games improved significantly.
                  However, I could never finish any of my projects on Roblox because I did not have the motivation to.
                  On Roblox, the games that I made never got popular.
                  As a result, I moved on to web development.

                  Web development was scary at first.
                  It was all so different from the coding language that I learned for Roblox (Lua).
                  But once I got into, it was just a breeze.
                  Everything felt so much easier, which led to boredom.
                  As a result, I began to focus more on web design than web development, which kick-started my love of design.
                  Once I started to focus on the design, I was faced with a new challenge.
                  Coding websites was easy, but making them look good was hard.
                  After diving deep into web development, I started to look at how to do graphic design.

                <p>
                  Graphic design started as a hobby.
                  But after only a few days, I really got into it.
                  At the time I was back into Roblox, which was the perfect platform for me to experiment with graphic design.
                  I made images and logos for my games, and games for other people.
                  I ended up eventually selling my services for a virtual currency on Roblox.
                  However, I still yearned for something that would challenge me more.
                  After a year or so, I found exactly what I was looking for.

                <p>
                  After years of searching, I finally found something that appealed to my love of design and my yearning for a coding challenge.
                  Unity is a coding engine used for making games for various kinds of platforms.
                  I had heard of it before, but I never really thought that I had the experience to use it.
                  However, I came to realize that this was exactly the challenge that I was looking for.
                  Developing on unity required knowing how to design and knowing how to code in C# or JavaScript.
                  Although I had no experience in C# or Java, I was determined to learn these new coding languages.
                  After a few months, I had made an app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jump-infinite/id1276415585?mt=8" target="_blank">Jump! - Infinite</a>) and published it to the iOS app store.
                  And this time, I actually had an audience who could play what I had created.
                  Because so many of my friends own an Apple device, many of them downloaded my game.
                  I was very satisfied and ready for more.
